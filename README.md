Run the Local AI ModelBefore starting the application, you must have the Ollama server running with the tinyllama model. Open your terminal and run:ollama run tinyllama
This will start the local AI server, typically at http://localhost:11434. Keep this terminal window open while you use the application.2. Clone the Repositorygit clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ai-notes-app.git](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ai-notes-app.git)
cd ai-notes-app
Remember to replace YOUR_USERNAME with your actual GitHub username.3. Backend SetupNavigate to the server directory, install dependencies, and set up your environment variables.# Go to the server folder
cd server

# Install dependencies
npm install
Next, create a .env file in the server directory and add the following variables.File: server/.envMONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/ai-notes-app
JWT_SECRET=YOUR_SUPER_SECRET_KEY
PORT=5001
Replace YOUR_SUPER_SECRET_KEY with a long, random string for security.4. Frontend SetupIn a new terminal, navigate to the ai-notes-client directory and install its dependencies.# Go to the frontend folder (from the root directory)
cd ai-notes-client

# Install dependencies
npm install
Running the ApplicationYou will need two separate terminals running to use the application: one for the backend and one for the frontend.Terminal 1: Start the Backend# Navigate to the server directory
cd server

# Start the server in development mode (with auto-reloading)
npm run dev
Your backend API will now be running at http://localhost:5001.Terminal 2: Start the Frontend# Navigate to the client directory
cd ai-notes-client

# Start the React development server
npm run dev
Your React application will open in your browser, usually at http://localhost:5173.üì° API EndpointsThe backend server provides the following RESTful API endpoints:EndpointMethodDescriptionRequires Auth/api/auth/signupPOSTRegister a new user.No/api/auth/loginPOSTLog in a user and get a JWT.No/api/notesGETGet all notes for the user.Yes/api/notesPOSTCreate a new note.Yes/api/notes/:idPUTUpdate an existing note.Yes/api/notes/:idDELETEDelete a note.Yes/api/ai/summarizePOSTGenerate a summary from content.Yesüí° Future Improvements[ ] Folders & Tags: Implement a system for organizing notes into folders and with tags.[ ] Rich Text Editing: Integrate a WYSIWYG editor like TinyMCE for enhanced note formatting.[ ] Real-time Collaboration: Add functionality for multiple users to edit a note simultaneously.[ ] Expanded AI Features: Use different models for grammar correction, content expansion, or tone analysis.üìÑ LicenseThis project is licensed under the MIT License.
